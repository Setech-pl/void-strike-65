## Checkpoint

### Repository HEAD

`experiment/hybrid-c-director`. HEAD carries the roadmap 4.4 Interceptor
`OWNER-SMOKE CANDIDATE` (section below) on top of `f4cb18b`, the
documentation-only reconciliation of the owner acceptance recorded here. The
candidate is not accepted; the accepted runtime is still `b4b942e`.

### Accepted runtime checkpoint

Commit `b4b942e` — `fix(debris): publish the debris late with exact ownership`
(owner smoke PASS 2026-09-16 for the pickup visibility, step 4.3 Stage 1 and the
debris late publication).

XEX SHA-256:
`965468077747f527b7d3f8ffeb7c37ace27377892ea5fc6f2e8aaf062d0d8a6e`

`npm run build:candidate -- --quiet` from a clean export of `b4b942e` reproduces
it (re-verified 2026-09-16); owner-smoke copy in
`build/owner-smoke/debris-late-96546807/`.

It contains the hybrid C Director foundation (`2df89da`), Light Wingman M1
(`41ace65`), the PMG pickup raster fix and per-type capsule silhouettes
(`f30754a`, `c2af6a6`), step 4.3 Stage 1 reusable resident capacity (`fca5e31`,
`0290d83`) and the debris late publication with exact ownership (`b4b942e`).

Previous accepted runtime checkpoint: `41ace65` (XEX `900152fe…`).

## Architecture

Hybrid **C/cc65 + ca65**, defined in
[hybrid-c-architecture.md](hybrid-c-architecture.md).

- C decides WHAT: Encounter Director, sector state, high-level lifecycle,
  `EnemyArchetype` (Raider, Light Wingman; Interceptor in the candidate),
  Raider and Light HP/state, Light archetype selection,
  admission/retire/recycle, formation motion, fire decisions, Director
  scheduling and RNG; progressively waves, AI, pickup policy, progression and
  boss state.
- ASM performs HOW: VBI/DLI, ANTIC/raster, PMG, Heavy, Light, debris and
  PairShot publication, character ring, backing/restore, hot collisions,
  hardware writes, audio hot paths, loader and XEX/ATR startup.

---

## Gameplay capability (accepted)

- Player Fighter movement and PairShot weapon (Normal/Rapid/Spread, Shield);
- two Heavy Raiders on P1/P2 with fire, contact damage, score and
  character-free destruction;
- one Light Wingman per Raider formation: character 2x1, centred behind Heavy
  slot 0, no side switching, published late after the playfield (no flicker),
  destructible, 5 points, retired before the capital sector; its 8-line
  vertical stepping relative to the leader is intentional and accepted;
- debris, published late with exact ownership (debris < effects < Light <
  PairShots < sparse near), visible from Y 24 in capital and post-capital
  fighter phases;
- Encounter Director Level 1, capital broadside traversal;
- fighter-sector pickup: deterministic admission (every third Raider kill by
  Player PairShot), PENDING/ACTIVE lifecycle, collection and boosters, visible
  as a fifth-player PMG mark published after the playfield, with a per-type
  capsule silhouette (Rapid slot, Spread fan, Shield crest) in `COLPF3`;
- white four-point starfield, one scanline per frame.

Deferred by the owner: smooth 1-line Light tracking (M2).

## CPU / RAM baseline (`2-evasive-fire3`, 920 PAL frames, XEX `96546807`)

| Measure | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| PAL max wall cycles | 29,258 |
| Target 31,200 headroom | 1,942 |
| Hard gate 32,568 headroom | 3,310 |
| Missed frames / extra VBI / DLI errors | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| Linked runtime | 17,470 B |
| Simultaneous residency | 19,295 B |
| Safe residency remaining | 2,892 B |

Reusable free capacity at this checkpoint (measured, `build/manifest.json`):
contiguous `HYBRID_C_EXT` tail 187 B (`$8F45-$8FFF`), `HYBRID_C_SECTOR` window
8 B, ENTITY_CODE tail 45 B, A2 kernel tail 18 B, pickup stream fill 14 B,
pickup/collision record 1,158 of 1,277 B cold capacity. Packed STARFIELD is
1,805 B: 7 B over the reviewed 1,798 B correction gate and 14 B under the
1,819 B hard staging limit (open decision below). Use identical replays when
comparing CPU.

---

## Known open defects and open decisions

- intermittent purple artifact after a Raider, not reproduced
  deterministically;
- Spread second capsule trace / final glyph reported in plan v4.12 §11, not
  re-verified since PairShot and the PMG capsule;
- debris known limitation: a cell yielded to a 25 Hz effect shows the effect's
  lower backing for the frame in which that effect expires (effects still
  publish mid-frame; measured once in 4,600 in-view frames);
- open owner decision: the packed STARFIELD correction gate (1,805 B against
  the reviewed 1,798 B). `tests/light-wingman.test.mjs` ("Light kernel
  placement…") and `tests/broadside-fire.test.mjs` keep failing on that gate on
  purpose; moving a reviewed margin is an owner decision;
- test debt: the full `node --test tests/*.test.mjs` run keeps known stale
  failures — 115 at `b4b942e` (measured 2026-09-16 on a clean export, counting
  the owner's uncommitted `tests/booster-admission-diagnostic.test.mjs`) and
  the same 115 names at the Interceptor candidate; treat a new failure name as
  a regression signal.

## Accepted increments in this checkpoint — summary and evidence

### Pickup runtime visibility (P0)

Root cause was raster: the missile plane was erased just after the frame gate
and rewritten mid-frame, so ANTIC saw zeroes when the beam crossed the capsule
(0/16 rows at beam crossing). The plane is now erased and redrawn in the
post-playfield window after `wait_frame_at_line $77`; each booster carries its
own capsule silhouette again. The earlier native gate used a `& $F0` mask that
inspected only half of the fifth-player missile bits. Owner decision 12 (solid
fifth-player PMG design) is unchanged. Evidence:
[diagnostics/stage-2b2d-pickup-raster-invisibility.json](diagnostics/stage-2b2d-pickup-raster-invisibility.json),
[diagnostics/stage-2b2e-pickup-capsule-silhouettes.json](diagnostics/stage-2b2e-pickup-capsule-silhouettes.json).

### Step 4.3 Stage 1 — reusable resident capacity

Option D = A + C1. C1 removed dead ENTITY_CODE (39 B). A moved the boot-only
GLUE hold from `$8600` to `$8300` and turned the former hold into the C area
`HYBRID_C_SECTOR_RAM` `$8602-$86F9` (248 B), carrying the five `sector_c_*`
functions (240 B) as a second LZ stream of the pickup/collision DFMC record
(8/8 records, 142 B manifest unchanged). The native write-watch
(`scripts/capacity-window-watch.mjs`) passed on XEX and ATR. Startup costs
+8,463 cycles once. Evidence:
[diagnostics/stage-2b2f-resident-capacity-glue-window.json](diagnostics/stage-2b2f-resident-capacity-glue-window.json);
the owner's post-capital debris observation was A/B-cleared as `PREEXISTING`:
[diagnostics/stage-2b2f-step43-post-capital-debris-ab.json](diagnostics/stage-2b2f-step43-post-capital-debris-ab.json).

### Debris late publication — exact ownership

Fighter OPEN: debris erase and render run adjacently inside the post-playfield
window, between the Light erase and the Light render. Capital frames: right
after the entity update, in the vertical blank, after every transient restore
and before every transient capture. The erase restores a cell only while it
still holds the published code; the render leaves a cell a rendered effect
owns to the effect; the recycled bottom ring row republishes the debris for the
frame that rotates it. `LIGHT_CODE` 133 → 203 B; PAL max 29,217 → 29,258
cycles. Native final-framebuffer gate (`node scripts/runtime-wall-trace.mjs
--debris-gate-only`) on three natural replays: 0 blank, 0 partial, 0
transitions, first visible Y 24 in capital and post-capital phases (pre-fix
`0-neutral-fire0` post-capital: 549 blank of 1,028 in view). Evidence:
[diagnostics/stage-2b2g-debris-late-publication.json](diagnostics/stage-2b2g-debris-late-publication.json).

## Interceptor (plan step 4.4) — `OWNER-SMOKE CANDIDATE` (2026-09-16)

Not accepted until the owner smokes it. Built on the accepted `b4b942e`; the
2026-09-16 `BLOCKED_PLACEMENT` attempt is superseded.

**Design (owner decision 18).** Third `EnemyArchetype` (byte offset 24): HP 1,
pursuit movement 2, double-tap fire 3 (2 shots 10 frames apart, then 56/44/32
frames EASY/MEDIUM/HARD), character 2x1 renderer, red PairShot, score `$15`,
Director value 1. It has no leader: it enters at X 124, Y 0, descends 2 lines
per frame and, every other frame, steps one 4-HPOS cell toward
`player_x & $FC`, clamped to 48-200. It retires at Y 232 or outside the fighter
sector, exactly like the Wingman. No P1/P2, PMG, renderer, publication,
collision, Director or capacity change.

**Selection contract.** The single Light slot is explicitly
archetype-selectable (`Wingman OR Interceptor`) through the C-owned byte
`light_archetype_offset` (12 or 24). The Light admission in
`enemy_c_spawn_raiders` and `enemy_c_light_tick` only read it; the rejected
per-admission alternation of `32f2c20` is removed. Its only writer is the
separate, labelled **provisional** schedule `encounter_light_schedule_advance()`
— table `{WINGMAN, INTERCEPTOR}` indexed by `encounter_light_index` — called
only when the slot is free, so a fresh game shows Wingman, Interceptor,
Wingman… Roadmap 4.6 replaces it. Schedule index finding: no existing state
qualifies — `STATE_EVENT_INDEX` advances once per Director event (including
deferral expiry and boss handoff), not once per Light admission, and a busy
slot skips admission, so it cannot index the table without changing meaning;
the accepted 1 B counter at `$8119` (`HYBRID_ENCOUNTER_STATE`, reset in
`lifecycle_c_init`) is used. ASM changes are limited to the
`light_archetype_offset` ABI equate, `ldx LIGHT_ARCHETYPE_OFFSET` in
`light_destroyed` and `adc LIGHT_SCORE_BCD,x` in the unchanged 17 B pad.

**Placement (measured, `b4b942e` → candidate).**

| Metric | Before | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `ENEMY_ARCHETYPE_DATA` (3 records + 2 B schedule table) | 24 B `$8C7D-$8C94` | 38 B `$8C7D-$8CA2` |
| `HYBRID_C_EXT` C | 485 B `$8C95-$8E79` | 635 B `$8CA3-$8F1D` |
| `LIGHT_CODE` (unchanged size) | 203 B `$8E7A-$8F44` | 203 B `$8F1E-$8FE8` |
| Extension record raw / packed (limit 960) | 712 / 636 B | 876 / 785 B |
| **Free `HYBRID_C_EXT` tail** | 187 B | **23 B `$8FE9-$8FFF`** |
| `LIGHT_RESIDENT` | 226 B | 229 B `$8776-$885A` |
| `PICKUP_CODE` (unchanged size, 769 B) | `$8858-$8B58` | `$885B-$8B5B` |
| Pickup stream fill / pickup record of 1,277 B cold | 14 B / 1,158 B | 11 B / 1,161 B |
| `HYBRID_LIGHT_STATE` | `$8100-$810B` | `$8100-$810F` |
| Provisional schedule counter | — | `$8119` (1 B) |
| Simultaneous / safe residency | 19,295 / 2,892 B | 19,459 / 2,728 B |
| cc65 CODE / RODATA; C stack / new ZP | 1,233 / 182 B; 0 / 0 | 1,383 / 196 B; 0 / 0 |

Physical resident code/data +167 B, BSS +5 B, in previously unowned RAM;
reserved envelopes unchanged; reusable free capacity −164 B extension tail and
−3 B pickup fill. The extension record grows from 6 to 7 ATR sectors
(166-172), moving the RNG record to sector 173. The **23 B extension tail is
scarce remaining capacity**: above the 16 B owner floor, but the next
archetype or C growth needs a placement decision. Linked runtime (17,470 B) and
packed STARFIELD (1,805 B) are unchanged. The cc65 stack/helper audit passes.

**CPU (measured).** Ten `runtime-wall-trace` baseline replays, native PAL, on
both `b4b942e` and the candidate: 0 missed frames, 0 extra VBI, 0 DLI errors in
all 20. Candidate worst maximum 29,918 cycles (`2-sweep-fire4`; target headroom
1,282, hard-gate headroom 2,650) against 29,697 for `b4b942e`
(`2-sweep-fire6`); `2-evasive-fire3` 29,258 → 29,605. Replays diverge after the
first Light admission, so per-session deltas (−259 to +831) mix gameplay
divergence with cost. Isolated C cost (6502 harness, HARD): Light tick worst
case 127 → 173 cycles for the Wingman and 182 for the Interceptor (firing
frame), formation admission 88 → 174 cycles once per formation; the score path
adds one `ldx` (3 cycles). A native Light-slot probe
(`DFTRACE_LIGHT_OUTPUT`, opt-in, no emulated cost) shows an Interceptor alive
in all ten candidate replays (1-3 lives each, lateral pursuit observed).

**Native gates.** `--boot-smoke-only`: 4 XEX/ATR cold-start sessions pass.
`--debris-gate-only` on the three natural replays: PASS — 0 blank, 0 partial,
0 disappearances, first visible Y 24 in capital and post-capital phases, 0
publications inside the scanned playfield, 0 missed frames; maxima 30,098 /
30,406 / 30,050 cycles against 30,008 / 29,764 / 30,022 for `b4b942e` on the
same (diverging) replays, all under the 31,200 target.

**Tests.** New `tests/light-interceptor.test.mjs` (13): selection contract, no
toggle source contract, provisional schedule order, admission per difficulty,
descent and retirement, pursuit clamp and alignment, independence from Heavy
slot 0, double-tap cadence, visibility and dying gates, 15-point kill and
fighter-only retirement, placement contract, no PMG. Updated:
`light-wingman` (third record, explicit Wingman re-admission),
`hybrid-lifecycle` (extension 876 B, the two static helper calls in the
generated-C audit), `enemy-combat` (union syntax), `source-contracts`. Full
suite: 626 tests, 115 failing, the identical failure-name set to `b4b942e`
(613 tests, 115 failing).

Candidate XEX `01a6ae07…`, owner-smoke copy in
`build/owner-smoke/light-interceptor-01a6ae07/`. Evidence:

## Current task

Owner smoke of the roadmap 4.4 Interceptor candidate (section above).

## Next roadmap step

After owner acceptance of 4.4: step 4.5 per the roadmap. The Raider-coloured
residual artifact remains an open P0 investigation.
